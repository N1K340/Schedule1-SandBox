#### About this mod

Sick of Uncle Nelson telling you what to do?
He has been gagged by the cartel and can't Issue orders anymore....

You start at the RV as any other save would, Uncle Nelson wants to talk to you on the payphone, he has a contact for you.. 
After that, the Cartel finds him. Not much is known on what they did to him. 

The quests data has been manipulated to make the game think the majority of quests have been completed, preventing Uncle Nelson from constantly telling you what to do. Some side quests remain open due to the way the game works.
- You must answer the payphone and talk to UN in order to unlock Albert and order grass seeds
- Mrs Ming and Donna are approachable at their respective properties to purchase if you want the Motel or Sweatshop
- The cashdrops from UN are collectable, the RV explosion is in effect dissabled
- All other functions, warehouse, dealers, suppliers unlock as per normal


Good luck making your adventure without the overbearing influence of Nelson
